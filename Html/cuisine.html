  <p class="maintext">Malaysia cuisine consists of cooking traditions and practices found in Malaysia, and reflects the 
  multiethnic makeup of its population. The vast majority of Malaysia&rsquo;s population can roughly be divided 
  among three major ethnic groups: Malays, Chinese and Indians. The mainstay of every Malaysian meal is 
  rice. At each meal, a generous helping accompanies a selection of dishes, including fish, seafood, 
  vegetables, and poultry.<br><span class="examples">Here are some examples of Malaysian cuisines:</span></p>

  <h4>Ba Ku Teh</h4>
  <p class="maintext">Bakuteh literally translates as &lsquo;meat bone tea&rsquo;, and its consiste of fatty pork 
  ribs simmered in a broth of herbs and spices including staranise, cinnamon, cloves, dong guai, fennel 
  seeds and garlic for as long as possibles. Additional ingredients may include offal, varieties of 
  mushroom, vegetables and pieces of tofu puffs.</p>
  
  <h4>Banana Leaf Rice</h4>
  <p class="maintext">Banana Leaf Rice is one of the great south Indian cuisines in Malaysia. In banana 
  leaf rice, white rice is served on a banana leaf with an assortment of vegerables, curried meat or fish,
  pickles, and the super addictive giant, round, flat crisps. Most of the time, however, only the gravy of 
  the curry will be served and no meat is served as it is meant to be a traditional Indian vegetarian dish. 
  This meal is traditionally eaten with the hand.</p>
  
  <h4>Hokkien Mee</h4>
  <p class="maintext">Hokkien Mee is a chinese style fried yellow noodles. It is a dish of thick yellow
  noodles braised in thick dark soy sauce with pork, squid, fish-cake and cabbage as the main ingredients
  and cubes of crispy fried pork lard as garnishing.</p>
  
  <h4>Nasi Lemak</h4>
  <p class="maintext">Nasi Lemak literally translate as &lsquo;rice in cream&rsquo; which is derived from the cooking
  process where regular white rice is soaked in coconut cream and then steamed to give a gorgeous, aroma 
  of coconut-perfumed white rice. The white rice is then wrapped in banana leaf or served on a plate. 
  The rice served with hot spicy sauce, hord boiled egg, cucumber slices, small dried anchovies and 
  roasted peanuts. This is a popular breakfast dish in Malaysia.</p>
  
  <h4>Satay</h4>
  <p class="maintext">Satays are meats on sticks over a BBQ. The popular kinds of stays are usually beef and chicken 
  satay. The bite-sized pieces of beef, mutton or chicken are marinated in spices, then skewered through 
  thin bamboo strips, are barbequed over charcoal fire. Satay is served with rice cake and a raw salad of 
  cucumber and onions. Sweet, spicy peanut sauce accompanies the dish.</p>
